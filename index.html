            <h2>The best new phones coming in 2021</h2>
             <p>2020 may be behind us, but its impact isn't, with major shakeups to the smartphone release calendar making 2021 the least predictable year in the phone industry since...well, 2020.

                Still, some things never change. They may be coming at slightly different times to normal but we've still got new flagships from Samsung, Xiaomi, OnePlus and more to look forward to in the next few months, and new iPhone and Pixel phones to follow later in the year.
                
                We're going to see 5G connectivity become a standard feature not only in flagships but also in mid-range and budget phones. We'll see more screens that boast 144Hz refresh rates, which is good news for gaming and video, and camera phones continue to pile on the megapixels and extra sensors, unlike anything we've ever seen before.

                Foldable designs are becoming cheaper and more durable, and battery technology is constantly improving too. We've also seen software enhancements too, making us even more excited for Android 12 and iOS 15, not to mention the first phones powered by the Snapdragon 888 chipset.

                In this feature, we've outlined all the major smartphone launches expected to take place in 2021 and beyond, along with an outline of what new features and hardware specifications have been or are likely to be included.

                Read on to ensure your next smartphone purchase is not immediately followed by the regret, tying you into a long two-year contract. (Remember that there is a chance you could upgrade your contract early.)</p>

            <h2 >iPad deals: every iPad Air 4 color is on sale right now at Amazon</h2>
             <p>iPad Air 4 deals took the holiday sales period by storm last year, offering up fleeting discounts on the latest release and proving incredibly popular among those looking to upgrade their tablet. Back then you were fairly limited in your color choice, with only the Sky Blue and Green models seeming to hold onto their discounts. 

                That's all changed with this latest round of iPad deals, however, as Amazon has just discounted its full range of iPad Air 4 models. You'll find the Rose Gold, Silver, Sky Blue, and Space Gray iPads available for $559 right now (was $599), with the Green model strangely sitting at a $10 premium - clocking in at $569. 
                
                That's an excellent offer if you missed out on the last wave of iPad deals because your color of choice wasn't featured. We don't know how long this offer will stand, though, and we're willing to bet these are going to move off the shelves fairly quickly.
                The iPad Air is a perfect lightweight replacement for your laptop - especially seeing as you'll be able to find plenty of iPad Magic Keyboard deals and cheap Apple Pencil sales to use with it as well. However, if you want to explore some Windows options, take a look at the latest Surface Pro deals as well. </p>

            <h2>Steam has never been more popular – and Valve promises big things for Linux gamers</h2>
             <p>Steam’s ‘year in review’ has just been published for 2020, complete with a raft of statistics which show that the gaming platform has never been more popular – along with some statements that Linux gamers will doubtless find exciting.

                Of course, it’s no great surprise to hear that more people were playing games on their PC last year – what with Covid-19 lockdowns and folks spending far more time inside at home – and indeed Steam’s stats show that there was a huge 50% increase in the number of hours spent gaming on the platform.

                We'll show you how to build a PC
                Gamers were collectively on Steam for over 31 billion hours, in fact, and there was a new high in terms of monthly active users at 120.4 million (with daily active users peaking at 62.6 million). A new record was also set in terms of concurrent users – folks playing simultaneously at any one given time – at 24.8 million.
                Valve’s coffers naturally felt the benefit of all this, and indeed the number of games purchased went up by just over 21% compared to 2019.

                VR gaming also gained popularity, with even stronger growth of game sales which were up 32% compared to the previous year. Apparently over 1.7 million Steam users tried VR games for the first time in 2020.
                
                There was also a marked increase in the number of gamers using a controller rather than keyboard and mouse, with some 46.6 million players using a gamepad in 2020 – compared to 31.8 million users in 2019. That’s a major increase of 46%.</p>
